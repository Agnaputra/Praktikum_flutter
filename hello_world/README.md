## Practical 1

### Step 1

This step is a quick way to access all available commands in VS Code, including those added by the Flutter extension.

1. Open the Visual Studio Code application.

2. Press the keys Ctrl + Shift + P simultaneously.

3. A search box will appear at the top of the screen. Type Flutter.

4. From the list that appears, click on the option Flutter: New Application Project.

Explanation: The Command Palette is like a "command center" in VS Code. Instead of hunting through menus, you can directly type any command you need. The Flutter: New Application Project command comes from the Flutter extension and is designed to create the entire basic folder and file structure needed for a Flutter app.

### Step 2: Select the Project Location

Now, Flutter needs to know where you want to save all the files for this new project.

1. After selecting "New Application Project", a file explorer window will open.

2. Navigate to the location where you usually save your coursework, for example, Documents/Practicals or another easy-to-find folder.

3. Do not enter an existing project folder. Simply select the "parent" folder where your new project will be created.

4. Click the "Select a folder to create the project in" button.

Explanation: üìÅ It's good practice to choose a neat and not-too-deep file path (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\Documents\‚Ä¶) to avoid potential issues with long path names, which can sometimes cause errors on certain operating systems.
